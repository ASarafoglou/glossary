## mutating joins

<dfn>Joins that act like the `dplyr::mutate()` function in that they add new columns to one table based on values in another table.</dfn>

A `left_join` keeps all the data from the first (left) table and joins anything that matches from the second (right) table.

```{r left-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Left Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/left_join.png")
```

A `right_join` keeps all the data from the second (right) table and joins anything that matches from the first (left) table.

```{r right-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Right Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/right_join.png")
```

An `inner_join` returns all the rows that have a match in the other table.

```{r inner-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Inner Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/inner_join.png")
```

A `full_join` lets you join up rows in two tables while keeping all of the information from both tables.

```{r full-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Full Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/full_join.png")
```
