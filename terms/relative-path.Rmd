## relative path

<dfn>The location of a file in relation to the working directory.</dfn> 

For example, if your working directory is `/Users/lisad/face_study/` and you want to refer to a file in the directory `/Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv`, the relative path is `data/faces.csv`. Use `../` to move up one directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# the working directory: /Users/lisad/face_study/

# read a file inside the wd: /Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv
qdat <- read_csv("data/faces.csv")

# read a file outside the wd: /Users/lisad/other_study/data/exp.csv
xdat <- read_csv("../other_study/data/exp.csv")
```

Make sure you always use relative paths in an [R Markdown](#r-markdown) document, which automatically sets the working directory to the directory that contains the .Rmd file.
