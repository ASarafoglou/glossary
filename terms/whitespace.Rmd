## whitespace

<dfn>Spaces, tabs and line breaks</dfn>

R mostly ignores whitespace, so you can use it to help you organise your code.

```{r}
# a and b are identical
a <- list(ctl = "Control Condition", exp1 = "Experimental Condition 1", exp2 = "Experimental Condition 2")

# but b is much easier to read
b <- list(ctl  = "Control Condition", 
          exp1 = "Experimental Condition 1", 
          exp2 = "Experimental Condition 2")
```
