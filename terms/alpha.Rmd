## alpha

<dfn>The cutoff value for making a decision to reject the null hypothesis</dfn>

If you are using null hypothesis significance testing ([NHST](n.html#NHST)), then you need to decide on a cutoff value called **alpha** for making a decision to reject the null hypothesis. We call p-values below the alpha cutoff [significant](s.html#significant). 

In psychology, alpha is traditionally set at 0.05, but there are good arguments for [setting a different criterion in some circumstances](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/05/justifying-your-alpha-by-minimizing-or.html){target="_blank"}.
