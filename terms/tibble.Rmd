## tibble

<dfn>A [container](#container) for [tabular data](#tabular-data) with some different properties to a [data frame](#data-frame)</dfn>

Tibbles are almost exactly like the [base R](#base-r) `data.frame` container type, but has some special printing functions, does not coerce character columns to factors, and does not typically use row names.

```{r}
# display the mtcars data frame
mtcars
```
```{r}
# convert the mtcars data frame to a tibble
tibble::as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "name")
```
