## default value

<dfn>A value that a [function](f.html#function) uses for an [argument](a.html#argument) if it is skipped.</dfn>

For example, `rnorm()` has default values of 0 and 1 for the `mean` and `sd`. Therefore, if you omit mean or sd from the function, it is the same as setting them to 0 and 1.

```{r}
a = rnorm(1000)
b = rnorm(1000, 0)
c = rnorm(1000, 0, 1)


ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(a), color = "red") + 
  geom_density(aes(b), color = "green") + 
  geom_density(aes(c), color = "blue")
```

If an argument does not have a default value, you can't omit it. In the example below, there is no default value for `n`.

```{r, error = TRUE}
x = rnorm()
```
