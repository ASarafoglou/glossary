## degrees of freedom

<dfn>The number of observations that are free to vary to produce a known outcome.</dfn>

If you run 5 people and ask them their age, and you know the mean age of those 5 people is 20.1, then four of those people can have any age, but the 5th person must have a specific age to maintain the mean of 20.1. The mean age here is the known outcome and four people's age can vary freely, so the *degrees of freedom* is 4.

You need to know the degrees of freedom (usually abbreviated *df*) to interpret test statistics like t-values and F-values.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "How p-values vary depending on the degrees of freedom for specific t-values in a t-test."}
dat <- crossing(
  t = seq(1.8, 2.6, .2),
  df = 1:100
) %>%
mutate(p = map2_dbl(t, df, pt, lower.tail = FALSE) * 2)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = df, y = p, color = as.factor(t))) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "t-value", palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "degrees of freedom (df)") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "p-value (two-tailed)")

```
