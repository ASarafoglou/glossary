## random factor

<dfn>A factor whose levels are taken to represent a proper subset of a population of interest, typically because the observed levels are the result of sampling.</dfn>

If you perform a study where the population of interest is "undergraduates at the University of Glasgow", you are very unlikely to obtain data from all approximately 20,000 undergraduate students. Instead, you would likely obtain a (hopefully random) sample of undergraduates, with each undergraduate forming a single 'level' of the 'subject' factor. By treating 'subject' as random rather than [fixed](f.html#fixed-factor) in your analysis, you will obtain parameter estimates that are closer to the true population values.
