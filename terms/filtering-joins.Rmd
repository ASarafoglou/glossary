## filtering joins

<dfn>Joins that act like the `dplyr::filter()` function in that they remove rows from the data in one table based on the values in another table. The result of a filtering join will only contain rows from the left table and have the same number or fewer rows than the left table.</dfn>


A `semi_join` returns all rows from the left table where there are matching values in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table.

```{r semi-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Semi Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/semi_join.png")
```

An `anti_join` return all rows from the left table where there are *not* matching values in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table.

```{r ani-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Anti Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/anti_join.png")
```
