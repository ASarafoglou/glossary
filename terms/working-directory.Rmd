## working directory

<dfn>The filepath where R is currently reading and writing files.</dfn>

If you are working in a [project](#project], the working directory is usually the main project directory. So if you want to save a file into a folder called "data" in that project folder, you can use a [relative path](#relative-path), which is automatically appended to the working directory, such as `readr::write_csv(my_data, "data/my_data.csv")`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() # get the current working directory
setwd("~/r/myfiles") # change the working directory
```

```{block, type="warning"}
Never set or change your working directory in a script. 
```
