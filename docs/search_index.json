["c.html", "C character chunk comment concatenate confidence intervals", " C character A data type representing strings of text. Examples of character data are: &quot;I am a string of characters&quot; paste(&quot;The answer is &quot;, 6+6) as.character(100) ## [1] &quot;I am a string of characters&quot; ## [1] &quot;The answer is 12&quot; ## [1] &quot;100&quot; chunk A block of R code in an R Markdown file. In an R Markdown file (.Rmd), you can include a chunk by surrounding the code as in the example below: ```{r chunk-name} mean_age &lt;- mean(ages) %&gt;% round(2) ``` comment You can annotate .R files or chunks in .Rmd files with comments by prefacing each line of the coment with one or more hash symbols (#). # I&#39;m demonstrating comments in this chunk # This comment will be added to the document outline ---- Comments get added to the document outline if you put four or more dashes, equal signs, or hashes at the end. This is a great way to keep track of more complicated scripts. concatenate To combine strings or vectors. When referring to strings, concatenate means to add strings together using the function paste (adds a space between strings) or paste0 (doesn’t add anything between strings). subject_name &lt;- &quot;Lisa&quot; paste(&quot;Hello,&quot;, subject_name) ## [1] &quot;Hello, Lisa&quot; When referring to other types of variables, concatenate can mean to create a vector with those variables, usually using the c function. For example, you could concatenate the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 10 like this: c(1, 3, 6, 10). You can concatenate two vectors as well: v1 &lt;- 1:5 v2 &lt;- 11:15 c(v1, v2) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 Remember, a vector can only have one data type. So if you concatenate a string vector and a numeric vector, the numbers will get turned into their string versions. If you concatenate an integer and a double vector, the integers will be converted to doubles. strings &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) integers &lt;- c(1L, 3L, 5L) doubles &lt;- c(1.1, 3.3, 5.5) c(strings, integers) c(doubles, integers) ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;5&quot; ## [1] 1.1 3.3 5.5 1.0 3.0 5.0 confidence intervals A type of interval estimate used to summarise a given statistic or measurement where a proportion of intervals calculated from the sample(s) will contain the true value of the statistic. For example, 95% Confidence Intervals of the mean state that if you were to run the same study on 100 samples and calculate this interval for each iteration of the study, then 95 of the intervals calculated will contain the true mean of the population. Most commonly cited Confidence Intervals are the 95% Confidence Interval and the 99% Confidence Interval. The 95CI and 99CI of the mean are calculated as follows: \\(95CI = \\mu ± 1.96 * SD\\) \\(99CI = \\mu ± 2.58 * SD\\) For example, given \\(\\mu\\) = 10 and \\(SD\\) = 1.25, the \\(95CI = [7.55, 12.45]\\) THere are a number of misconceptions about Confidence Intervals and it would be worth reading the following papers: Greenland, S., Senn, S.J., Rothman, K.J. et al.

["p.html", "P package panes project", " P package A group of R functions. Many useful functions are built into R and available by default whenever you start it up. But some of the most powerful things you can do with R require packages of functions that are written by the community. The functions in these packages aren’t available until you install the package (using install.packages(&quot;package_name&quot;) or clicking Install on the Packages pane; this only needs to be done if the package isn’t already installed). Once that package is installed (kind of like downloading an app to your phone), you can use it in any script by loading that package as a library at the top of your script (e.g., (library(ggplot2)). You can alternatively type the package name and two colons before any function from that package to use it without loading all of its functions into the library (e.g., ggplot2::geom_histogram()). This sort of notation is also used to disambiguate function names if two packages have functions with the same names. panes RStudio is arranged with four window “panes”. By default, the upper left pane is the source pane, where you view and edit source code from files. The bottom left pane is usually the console pane, where you can type in commands and view output messages You can change the location of panes and what tabs are shown under Preferences &gt; Pane Layout.
