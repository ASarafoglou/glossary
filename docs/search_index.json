["index.html", "Glossary Overview Using the glossary", " Glossary psyTeachR Team 2019-06-30 Overview The glossary defines common jargon you might encounter while learning R. This specialised vocabulary can help you to communicate more efficiently about coding and to search for solutions to problems, but the terms aren’t always self-explanatory. Using the glossary If you are using the [psyTeachR book template](](/book-template/), you can use the glossary function to automatically link to a term in the and automatically include a tooltip with a short definition when you hover over the term. Use the following syntax in inline r: glossary(&quot;word&quot;). For example, common data types are integer, double, and character. If you’re not using the psyTeachR book template, the functions are below. myglossary &lt;- list() ## link to glossary with shortdef on hover glossary &lt;- function(term, display = NULL, shortdef = &quot;&quot;, link = TRUE) { lcterm &lt;- gsub(&quot; &quot;, &quot;-&quot;, tolower(term), fixed = TRUE) if (is.null(display)) display &lt;- term first_letter &lt;- substr(lcterm, 1, 1) url &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/&quot;, first_letter) if (shortdef == &quot;&quot;) { hash &lt;- paste0(&quot;#&quot;, lcterm, &quot; dfn&quot;) shortdef &lt;- tryCatch(xml2::read_html(url) %&gt;% rvest::html_node(hash) %&gt;% rvest::html_text() %&gt;% gsub(&quot;\\&#39;&quot;, &quot;&amp;#39;&quot;, .), error = function(e) { &quot;&quot; }) } ## add to global glossary for this book myglossary[lcterm] &lt;&lt;- shortdef if (link) { paste0(&quot;&lt;a class=&#39;glossary&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39; title=&#39;&quot;, shortdef, &quot;&#39; href=&#39;&quot;, url, &quot;#&quot;, lcterm, &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot;, display, &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;) } else { paste0(&quot;&lt;a class=&#39;glossary&#39; title=&#39;&quot;, shortdef, &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot;, display, &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;) } } glossary_table &lt;- function() { as.data.frame(myglossary) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% rownames_to_column(var=&quot;term&quot;) %&gt;% rename(&quot;definition&quot; = V1) %&gt;% mutate(term = paste0(&quot;&lt;a class=&#39;glossary&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39; &quot;, &quot;href=&#39;https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/&quot;, substr(term, 1, 1), &quot;#&quot;, term, &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot;, gsub(&quot;.&quot;, &quot; &quot;, term, fixed = 1), &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(term) %&gt;% knitr::kable(escape = FALSE) } If you need to link to a definition, but are using a different form of the word, add the display version as the second argument (display). You can also override the automatic short definition by providing your own in the third argument (shortdef). Add the argument link = FALSE if you just want the hover definition and not a link to the psyTeachR glossary. glossary(&quot;data type&quot;, display=&quot;Data Types&quot;, shortdef=&quot;My custom definition of data types&quot;, link = FALSE) [1] “Data Types” You can add a glossary table to the end of a chapter with the following code. It creates a table of all terms used in that chapter previous to the glossary_table() function. ```{r, echo=FALSE, results=‘asis’} glossary_table() ``` term definition data type My custom definition of data types If you want to contribute to the glossary, fork the github project, add your terms and submit a pull request, or suggest a new term at the issues page.

In an R Markdown file (.Rmd), you can include a chunk by surrounding the code as in the example below: ```{r chunk-name} mean_age &lt;- mean(ages) %&gt;% round(2) ``` comment You can annotate .R files or chunks in .Rmd files with comments by prefacing each line of the coment with one or more hash symbols (#). # I&#39;m demonstrating comments in this chunk # This comment will be added to the document outline ---- Comments get added to the document outline if you put four or more dashes, equal signs, or hashes at the end. This is a great way to keep track of more complicated scripts. concatenate To combine strings or vectors. When referring to strings, concatenate means to add strings together using the function paste (adds a space between strings) or paste0 (doesn’t add anything between strings). subject_name &lt;- &quot;Lisa&quot; paste(&quot;Hello,&quot;, subject_name) ## [1] &quot;Hello, Lisa&quot; When referring to other types of variables, concatenate can mean to create a vector with those variables, usually using the c function. For example, you could concatenate the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 10 like this: c(1, 3, 6, 10). You can concatenate two vectors as well: v1 &lt;- 1:5 v2 &lt;- 11:15 c(v1, v2) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 Remember, a vector can only have one data type. So if you concatenate a string vector and a numeric vector, the numbers will get turned into their string versions.

["p.html", "P package panes project", " P package A group of R functions. Many useful functions are built into R and available by default whenever you start it up. But some of the most powerful things you can do with R require packages of functions that are written by the community. The functions in these packages aren’t available until you install the package (using install.packages(&quot;package_name&quot;) or clicking Install on the Packages pane; this only needs to be done if the package isn’t already installed). Once that package is installed (kind of like downloading an app to your phone), you can use it in any script by loading that package as a library at the top of your script (e.g., (library(ggplot2)). You can alternatively type the package name and two colons before any function from that package to use it without loading all of its functions into the library (e.g., ggplot2::geom_histogram()). This sort of notation is also used to disambiguate function names if two packages have functions with the same names. panes RStudio is arranged with four window “panes”. By default, the upper left pane is the source pane, where you view and edit source code from files. The bottom left pane is usually the console pane, where you can type in commands and view output messages You can change the location of panes and what tabs are shown under Preferences &gt; Pane Layout.

For example, if your working directory is /Users/lisad/face_study/ and you want to refer to a file in the directory /Users/lisad/face_study/data/faces.csv, the relative path is data/faces.csv.
